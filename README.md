# Game of Life Simulation

A Python-based simulation of **Conway's Game of Life**, implemented with the **Turtle Graphics** module. This interactive simulation visualizes how simple rules can lead to complex, emergent behaviors. Users can also tweak parameters to experiment with new behaviors and patterns.

## 🚀 Features

* Real-time simulation of Conway's Game of Life
* Customizable cell update rules
* Interactive visual grid with Turtle Graphics
* Easy to extend or modify for experimentation

## 🧠 About Conway's Game of Life

The Game of Life is a zero-player game developed by mathematician **John Conway**, where each cell on a grid follows simple rules to live, die, or reproduce based on its neighbors. The simulation evolves over generations, often leading to beautiful, chaotic, or stable patterns.

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/AyomideOlumideAttah/Game-Of-Life-Simulation.git
$ cd Game-Of-Life-Simulation

# Run the main script
$ python main.py
```

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.7+
* No third-party libraries needed (uses built-in `turtle` module)

---

## 🕹️ Usage

Once you run the script:

* A turtle-based GUI window will launch
* The game initializes a grid of cells
* You can tweak parameters in the script to modify rules or grid size

---

## 🧪 Customization

In `main.py` or the `conway/` directory, you can:

* Change the grid size or cell size
* Modify the birth/survival conditions
* Load predefined patterns or generate random ones
